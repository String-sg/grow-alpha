    title: 'Learn to use AI: creating songs to help students\' remember, inspired by Eugene Teo (SJI)',
    content: `As an educator, you’re always looking for ways to make learning stick. Sometimes it’s a clever analogy, sometimes it’s a hands-on demo… and sometimes, it might just be a song.

In this episode - inspired by Eugene Teo from St Joseph’s Institution (SJI) -  you’ll discover how you can use AI to turn concepts into music, how audio learning connects with sleep research, and how you can start experimenting with these tools in your own classroom. We will use Chemistry which is his teaching subject but feel free to abstract to your teaching subject! 

Step 1: Break Content into Lyrics (with AI Help)

Now, if you’re thinking, *“But I’m not musical at all — how on earth do I write lyrics?”* — don’t worry. You don’t need to be a songwriter to do this. In fact, you can use AI to transform your subject matter into lyrics for you.

Here’s how:

1. **Start with your key concept** — for example, *Ionic Bonding involves the transfer of electrons between atoms*.
2. **Feed it into a prompt** that asks AI to generate simple, rhythmic lines. You can even specify the style, such as rap, lofi, or pop.
3. **Tweak if needed** — keep it short and memorable, one idea per song.

Here are some **ready-to-use prompts** you can copy and paste into ChatGPT, NotebookLM, or any AI assistant:

- **Prompt for catchy but simple lyrics:**
    
    *“Turn this Chemistry concept into short, rhyming lyrics for a lofi-style educational song: Ionic bonding involves the transfer of electrons between atoms.”*
    
- **Prompt for mnemonic-style lyrics:**
    
    *“Summarise this concept into 4 simple, rhythmic lines that sound like a chant students could remember: Covalent bonding is the sharing of electrons between atoms.”*
    
- **Prompt for a playful rap:**
    
    *“Write 6 lines of fun, student-friendly rap lyrics to explain the difference between covalent and ionic bonding.”*
    
- **Prompt for lullaby-style study aid:**
    
    *“Write calm, soothing lyrics about the periodic table trends in a lullaby style to help students relax while revising.”*
    

You can always reference the link below for inspiration and see how others are doing it in practice.

Remember, you’re not aiming for chart-toppers. You’re aiming for hooks that *lodge in memory*. The AI does the creative heavy lifting — you just decide the concept you want students to remember.

Step 2: Turn Lyrics into Music

Next, use an AI music generator. Two tools you can try are:

- **Suno** — paste your lyrics, choose a style like “lofi hip hop” or “acoustic pop,” and it generates a full song with vocals.
- **Udio** — another strong option with more style control.

Try this workflow:

1. Draft lyrics in a Google Doc.
2. Copy them into Suno.
3. Select “lofi” if you want calming study vibes, or “pop” if you want energy.
4. Generate, listen, and regenerate if needed.

In minutes, you’ll have a polished track your students can replay on loop.

---

Step 3: Share and Reinforce

Once you have songs, think about delivery. You could:

- Build a **Spotify or YouTube playlist** of study songs.
- Pair each song with a **NotebookLM video summary** of the same topic.
- Use the songs as **study cues** something students can play before class, during revision, or even on commutes.

---

Step 4: Connect Music with Sleep Research

Here’s where it gets really fascinating. In deciding audio as the format, Eugene himself was in part inspired by Master Teacher **Cher Chong Tan**, explored the role of sleep in academic success. Research into **Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR)** shows that when students are re-exposed to sounds linked to what they learned earlier, during deep sleep, recall improves.

So imagine this: your student watches a short NotebookLM Chemistry summary before bed. Then, as they fall asleep, they play a subtle Chemistry-themed lofi track you’ve created. The music isn’t just background noise — it’s an auditory cue linked to what they revised. Could it help their brain consolidate the material more deeply overnight?

We don’t know for sure yet. But it’s the kind of playful, research-informed experiment that makes teaching exciting.

By combining AI music tools like Suno or Udio with insights from sleep science, you’re not just giving students another study resource. You’re creating *learning environments* — sounds that travel with them outside the classroom, into their playlists, their revision routines, even their dreams.

Some students might laugh, some might cringe. But if even one formula or concept sticks because of a track you made, that’s a win.

AI isn’t here to replace your pedagogy. It’s here to amplify it. To give you new ways — songs, sounds, sleep cues — to help learning last.`,

    title: "Supporting Students with Dyslexia: What Every Teacher Needs to Know",
    content: `Welcome back! I'm excited about today's topic because it's something so many of us encounter in our classrooms. Picture this - you've got a bright, articulate student who participates beautifully in class discussions, asks thoughtful questions, but the moment you ask them to read aloud, they freeze up completely.

Oh, I know exactly what you mean! I had a student like that last year - brilliant in math, could explain complex concepts orally, but when it came to reading time, she'd suddenly need the bathroom or pretend she couldn't find her book. At first, I thought she was just shy or maybe being defiant.

That's such a common assumption we make, isn't it? But here's what's fascinating - recent brain research is showing us exactly what's happening when students with dyslexia read, and it's completely changed how we understand this learning difference.

Really? What does the brain imaging show us?

Well, it turns out that reading literally rewires our brains. There's nothing about our brains that was naturally designed to read - we have to repurpose areas that were meant for other things. When we read, we're integrating sound processing areas with visual recognition areas, and then connecting those to pronunciation areas in the front of the brain.

That's incredible! So it's like our brains are performing this complex juggling act every time we read?

Exactly! And here's where it gets interesting for our students with dyslexia. Brain imaging shows that their brains process reading differently - they rely more on the right hemisphere and frontal areas, which means when they read a word, it literally takes a longer path through their brain and can get delayed.

No wonder they seem to be working so much harder! But I've heard people say dyslexia is about seeing letters backwards - is that what's really happening?

That's actually one of the biggest myths out there! Students with dyslexia see things exactly the same way we do. The real issue is phonological processing - they have trouble manipulating the sounds in language. So if I said the word "cat" and asked them to remove the 'c' sound, that mental manipulation is really challenging for them.

Oh, that makes so much sense! So when they're trying to read the word "fantastic," what's actually happening in their minds?

They have to break it into chunks - "fan-tas-tic" - and decode each part. While other students recognize the whole word instantly, students with dyslexia are still working through each syllable. All that mental energy spent decoding makes it incredibly hard to focus on comprehension.

And I bet that's why they spell phonetically too - like writing "stik" for "stick"?
Exactly! They're doing exactly what we taught them - sounding it out - but they need more explicit instruction about spelling patterns and rules. And here's something important - dyslexia affects up to one in five people, and it runs in families. You might have one family member who just struggles with spelling while another has severe difficulty with even simple words.

That's a huge percentage of our students! So what does effective intervention actually look like, based on this brain research?

The research is really clear on this - intensive, multi-sensory instruction that explicitly teaches phonics rules and how language is structured. When students get this kind of systematic instruction, brain imaging actually shows their brains starting to use the left hemisphere more efficiently, just like typical readers.

That's amazing - their brains can literally rewire themselves! What about all those alternative treatments we hear about - the colored lenses, balance exercises, eye movement training?
The research shows those interventions that focus on visual training or balance don't address the core issue. Remember, dyslexia is fundamentally about mapping language sounds to print. Effective interventions need to target that phonological processing directly.

So we need to focus on the sounds and letter connections. But I'm curious - are there any strengths that come with having a dyslexic brain?

Oh, this is where the research gets really exciting! There's growing evidence that people with dyslexia often have enhanced visual-spatial skills. They're better at seeing the big picture, pulling together lots of visual information, and detecting patterns that others might miss. Think about successful people like Steven Spielberg, Whoopi Goldberg, or Picasso - all have dyslexia.
That's fascinating! So it's not a deficit, it's a different way of processing information?

Exactly! This is where the concept of neurodiversity comes in. Instead of seeing dyslexia as a disorder, we can understand it as a neurobiological variation. These students' brains work differently, and while that creates challenges with reading, it can also lead to unique strengths.
So how do we support these students in our day-to-day teaching?

Start with that structured, explicit phonics instruction we talked about. Use paired reading where you read together at their pace with books they can handle - remember that 95% success rate. Create visual supports and break tasks into smaller chunks to help with their working memory challenges.

And don't forget organization support - these students often struggle with executive function too because their brains are working overtime on basic reading tasks.

Absolutely! Simple checklists for homework preparation, clear routines, and breaking multi-step instructions into smaller parts all help reduce their cognitive load.

What about building their confidence? I imagine many of these students feel frustrated or even embarrassed.

That's huge. Focus on their strengths - maybe they're fantastic at explaining concepts orally or solving complex problems. Use their interests to motivate reading practice. And always remember that their struggles with reading don't reflect their intelligence or potential.
I think it's also important for us to understand that when we see a student avoiding reading or seeming unmotivated, they might actually be working twice as hard as everyone else just to decode simple text.

Exactly. And here's something encouraging - the brain research shows that it's never too late to improve reading skills. Even adult brains can form new neural pathways with the right instruction. Our students' brains are incredibly malleable and capable of change.
That gives me so much hope! Before we wrap up, what's the one key takeaway you want teachers to remember about supporting students with dyslexia?

I'd say remember that these students need us to understand their neurodiversity, not fix them. They need explicit, systematic instruction in phonics and spelling patterns, plenty of practice with appropriate-level texts, and recognition of their unique strengths. With proper support, they absolutely can become successful readers and learners.

And don't forget that early intervention makes such a difference. If you suspect a student might have dyslexia, advocate for assessment and support services. The sooner we provide appropriate instruction, the better outcomes we'll see.

Thanks so much for joining us today, everyone! We hope these insights about the dyslexic brain help you better support all your learners. Remember to check out the show notes for additional resources, and we'll see you next week for another episode!`,

    title: 'ADHD in Classrooms: Strategies That Work',
    content: `Hey there! So I have a question for you - have you ever had a student who seems brilliant during discussions but can't seem to finish a worksheet? Or maybe one who's constantly moving, fidgeting, and just can't sit still during story time?

Oh absolutely! I think every teacher has encountered students like that. And you know what? More often than not, we're looking at kids who might have ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

Exactly! And that's what we want to dive into today. Because understanding ADHD isn't just about getting a diagnosis - it's about creating classrooms where all our students can thrive.

Right, and I think there's still so much confusion about what ADHD actually is. I mean, we've all heard people say things like "Oh, all kids are hyperactive" or "They just need more discipline."

Those misconceptions drive me crazy! ADHD is actually a real condition connected to brain development. It's not about kids being naughty or parents not setting boundaries. We're talking about genuine differences in how the brain processes attention, activity levels, and impulse control.

And here's what's really important for us as educators - ADHD shows up in two main ways. There's the inattentive type and the hyperactive-impulsive type. Some kids have symptoms from both groups.

Let's break that down for teachers who might be listening during their prep period. What does inattentive ADHD actually look like in the classroom?

Great question! So picture Sarah in your third-grade class. She's the one who seems to drift off during instructions, even when you're looking right at her. She makes those careless mistakes on math worksheets - not because she doesn't know the material, but because she missed key details. Her desk is a disaster zone, she's always losing her pencils, and she starts one activity but gets distracted and moves to something else.

Oh, that's so relatable! I had a student just like that last year. I kept thinking she wasn't listening to me, but really her brain was just processing things differently.
Exactly! And then there's the hyperactive-impulsive type. This is Marcus who can't stay in his seat during carpet time, who blurts out answers before you finish asking the question, and who talks constantly - I mean constantly! He interrupts other students, has trouble waiting his turn in line, and his hands are always moving, tapping, fidgeting with something.

And here's the thing teachers need to remember - these aren't choices the kids are making. Their brains are wired differently. I always tell my colleagues, if a child had a broken leg, we wouldn't expect them to run laps, right? Same principle applies here.

That's such a helpful way to think about it! So what can we actually do in our classrooms to support these students? I know teachers are always looking for practical strategies they can implement tomorrow.

Well, let's start with some simple environmental changes. For students with attention difficulties, try seating them at the front of the classroom, away from high-traffic areas and distractions like the pencil sharpener or classroom door.

And don't underestimate the power of positive reinforcement! Instead of constantly correcting behavior, catch them doing things right. "Marcus, I love how you're sitting criss-cross applesauce right now!" or "Sarah, you really focused on that first math problem - great job!"

Oh, that reminds me of something that really works - breaking tasks into smaller chunks. Instead of giving a worksheet with twenty problems, maybe give five problems at a time. It's the same work, but it feels more manageable.

Yes! And for our hyperactive movers and shakers, build in movement opportunities. Maybe they're the paper monitors, or they get to erase the board. Some teachers even use standing desks or wobble cushions.

I love that approach! What about organizational strategies? Because I know that's a huge challenge for many of these students.

Organization is definitely key! Teach it explicitly - don't assume they'll pick it up naturally. Color-coding folders, using visual schedules, having a consistent place for turning in work. Some students benefit from having a weekly planner where they can check off completed tasks.

And here's something that might surprise some teachers - clear, specific instructions work better than general requests. Instead of saying "Clean up your desk," try "Put all the pencils in the pencil box and stack your papers in the turn-in tray."

That makes so much sense! What about when these strategies aren't enough? When should teachers think about reaching out for additional support?

That's such an important question. If you're consistently seeing these behaviors across different settings - not just during math, but during reading, lunch, recess - and they're significantly impacting the child's learning or social relationships, it might be time to have a conversation.

Teachers can start by documenting what they're observing. Keep notes about specific behaviors, when they happen, and what strategies you've tried. This information is incredibly valuable for parents and healthcare providers.

And don't forget about your school counselors! They're often connected to community mental health services and can provide guidance on next steps. The key is early intervention - the sooner we can support these students, the better.

Now, I want to address something that comes up a lot in teacher conversations - medication. Some teachers feel uncomfortable when students are on ADHD medication, or they worry about side effects.

It's completely normal to have questions about medication! But remember, that's a decision between the family and their healthcare provider. Our job is to observe and communicate what we're seeing in the classroom - both challenges and successes.

Exactly! And if a student is on medication, we can provide valuable feedback to families about how it's working during school hours. Are we seeing improved focus? Better social interactions? This information helps doctors adjust treatment plans.

Let's talk about something else that's crucial - working with parents. Sometimes parents are defensive or overwhelmed when teachers bring up concerns about ADHD.
I get it - no parent wants to hear that their child is struggling. I always try to start conversations by highlighting the child's strengths. "Marcus has such creative ideas during our science discussions, and I want to make sure we're supporting him in all areas."

That's a great approach! And remember, parents are dealing with these behaviors at home too. They might be feeling frustrated, guilty, or exhausted. A little empathy goes a long way.

Absolutely. I always emphasize that we're all on the same team - we want what's best for their child. Sometimes parents have tried everything they can think of and are relieved to have professional support.

What about the other students in the classroom? How do we help them understand and be supportive?

Such a good question! You don't need to discuss specific diagnoses, but you can talk generally about how everyone learns differently. "Some people need to move while they think, some people need extra time, and that's perfectly okay."

And model patience and understanding in your own interactions. When kids see you responding calmly and positively to students who need extra support, they learn to do the same.

I've found that when teachers create inclusive, understanding environments, the whole classroom benefits. Students become more empathetic and accepting of differences.
Before we wrap up, let's talk about teacher self-care. Supporting students with ADHD can be demanding. It requires extra planning, patience, and energy.

So true! It's okay to acknowledge that some days are harder than others. Connect with colleagues, ask for help when you need it, and celebrate the small victories. Remember, you're making a real difference in these students' lives.

And don't forget - you don't have to be perfect! Even small changes in your approach can have a big impact. Maybe this week you try one new strategy, and next week you add another.

The key is consistency and patience. Building new habits and skills takes time for all students, especially those with ADHD. But the progress, when it comes, is incredibly rewarding.

I think what I want teachers to remember most is that students with ADHD aren't broken - they just learn and process the world differently. With the right support and understanding, they can absolutely succeed in school and beyond.

So let's do a quick recap for our teacher friends out there. ADHD is a real neurological condition that affects attention, activity levels, and impulse control. In the classroom, you might see students who have trouble focusing, staying organized, sitting still, or controlling their impulses.

Simple strategies can make a huge difference - preferential seating, positive reinforcement, breaking tasks into chunks, building in movement, and teaching organizational skills explicitly.

Document what you observe, work collaboratively with families, and don't hesitate to reach out to school counselors or other support staff when you need guidance.
Remember, creating an inclusive classroom benefits everyone. When we support students with ADHD, we're creating environments where all learners can thrive.
And finally, be patient with yourself and with your students. Change takes time, but every small step matters.

Thanks so much for joining us today! We hope this gives you some practical ideas to try in your classroom this week. Don't forget to catch our next quick tip between classes, and remember - you've got this!

Until next time, keep making a difference, one student at a time!`,

    title: 'Managing Student Meltdowns with CALM & CASE (Singapore)',
    content:`Today we’re talking about a situation almost every teacher in Singapore will face at some point: student meltdowns in the classroom.

Whether you’re teaching Primary 1 or Secondary 4, knowing how to respond can mean the difference between a minor disruption and a major crisis.

What is a meltdown?

A meltdown isn’t a tantrum or defiance. It’s when a student experiences an intense emotional response and temporarily loses behavioural control. They might cry, scream, throw objects, or run. Importantly: they are **not in control** at this point. Traditional discipline won’t work — in fact, it can make things worse.

MOE’s CALM framework

Singapore schools often use the CALM approach:

C Check for safety. Move other students or objects out of harm’s way.
A Avoid power struggles. Keep your voice calm, avoid commands, and acknowledge emotions.
L Let others know. Use your school’s system to call for help — many schools now use WhatsApp or intercom alerts.
M Make sure an adult stays. The child should never be left alone until calm is restored.

What are some warning signs & prevention?

Often, there are early signals: head on the desk, “I don’t know” answers, pacing, hiding, or asking repeated anxious questions. Spotting these signs lets us step in earlier. Some schools use exit cards or calm corners so students can self-regulate before escalation.

After the meltdown: the CASE framework provides some guidance on post-meltdown handling

C Communicate with parents, leaders, and relevant staff in a supportive way.
A Analyse triggers together with the student, peers, or parents.
S Strengthen supports add routines, spaces, or trained staff.
E Equip the student with coping strategies, and educate peers on supportive behaviour.

Our classrooms are exam-focused, fast-paced, and often crowded. 

Teachers juggle safety, learning, and relationships all at once. Meltdowns aren’t about disobedience; they’re about students being overwhelmed beyond coping capacity. Managing them well requires whole-school systems, collaborative support, and a mindset of compassion. Be kind and patient - not just to your students but also yourselves.

Some questions to help us situate ourselves in relation to our school environment for handling meltdowns:

1. How well does your school’s current SOP prepare all teachers to respond to meltdowns?
2. Do students have safe spaces or preventive tools (like exit cards) before crises erupt?
3. How do we ensure post-meltdown follow-up focuses on support and learning, not just discipline?
4. What training and peer-support structures exist so no teacher has to manage these situations alone?

Remember: meltdowns are not about challenging authority, but about distress. Our job is to stay CALM, follow CASE after, and build systems that prevent crises where possible. All the best!
