    title: 'Supporting Students with Dyslexia: What Every Teacher Needs to Know',
    description: '**Overview**\nThis episode dives deep into how educators can better understand and support students with dyslexia in mainstream classrooms. Backed by current brain research and real classroom experiences, the conversation unpacks what dyslexia really is (and isnâ€™t), why some common myths persist, and how teachers can implement practical, research-based strategies that empower struggling readers. By embracing neurodiversity and applying structured support, educators can help students with dyslexia thrive both academically and emotionally.',
