    description: `Using JSON style guides allows teachers to lock key visual elements (style, camera angle, and colour palette) so that AI-generated images remain consistent across lessons, reducing distractions and improving student focus on learning.

You'll be able to:
1. Apply JSON style guides to lock in core design elements (style, camera, colours) and maintain consistency across slides and teaching materials.
2. Differentiate between fixed and variable fields in prompts so that only lesson-specific content changes while the overall look stays coherent.
3. Implement a practical team workflow for generating visuals that align with department or school branding, making it easier for students to recognise and follow materials.`,
    summary: `1 Prompt injection is when someone sneaks extra instructions into an AI request, tricking the system into ignoring its original task.

2 It shows that AI can be manipulated through language, leading to embarrassing outputs or leaked "hidden" instructions — but usually with reputational rather than catastrophic risks.

3 Treat AI critically, know the common tricks ("ignore the above," translation hacks, role-play outlets), and use awareness as the best safeguard in schools.`,

Use AI tools like ChatGPT, Suno, or Udio to convert subject concepts into lyrics and music, even if you\'re not musically inclined.\n2. Integrate audio-based study aids into your teaching — from playlists to paired video summaries — to reinforce learning beyond the classroom.\n3. Apply sleep research such as Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) by pairing summaries and lofi tracks with bedtime routines to strengthen student recall.',
    summary: '1. Turn Concepts into Lyrics – Use AI prompts to transform tricky topics (like ionic bonding) into short, catchy lines. You don\'t need to be musical — AI does the heavy lifting.\n2. Generate Songs with AI Tools – Drop your lyrics into Suno or Udio, pick a style (lofi, pop, rap), and in minutes you\'ll have a polished track for students to study with.\n3. Boost Recall with Audio & Sleep – Pair songs with NotebookLM video summaries, then encourage students to listen before bed. Research on Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) suggests audio cues during sleep can strengthen memory.',

Backed by current brain research and real classroom experiences, the conversation unpacks what dyslexia really is (and isn’t), why some common myths persist, and how teachers can implement practical, research-based strategies that empower struggling readers. By embracing neurodiversity and applying structured support, educators can help students with dyslexia thrive both academically and emotionally.',

Support Students Holistically in the Classroom (paired reading, visual support, leverage strengths; reframing lack of motivation as perhaps due to working twice as hard to decode text and hence appear disengaged)\n3.
